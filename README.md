## This application is a base to launch a project with [Socket.IO](https://socket.io/) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), it can be modified according to your project

### 🛠️ Installation
To install it, download the project, go to the folder and run the command:
```
npm install
```
or if you use yarn
```
yarn install
```

I would add modules little by little over time to make this base more complete 🤖

Do not hesitate to give me a little feedback on things that you would like to bring to this base 😊
